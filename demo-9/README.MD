## This demo reviews EBS with Terraform Examples

## Here is what ChatGPT has to say about this topic

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create and manage virtual disk volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes provide persistent storage for your data and are highly available, reliable, and scalable.

With Terraform, you can use code to automate the creation and management of AWS resources, including EC2 instances and EBS volumes.

Here's an example of how you can use Terraform to create an EC2 instance with a mounted EBS volume:

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  }

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 8
    volume_type = "gp2"
  }
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
  availability_zone = "${var.region}"
  size              = 8

  tags = {
    Name = "example-volume"
  }
}

resource "aws_volume_attachment" "example" {
  device_name = "/dev/xvdf"
  volume_id   = "${aws_ebs_volume.example.id}"
  instance_id = "${aws_instance.example.id}"
}
```

In this example, we're using the ```aws``` provider to specify the region where the resources will be created. Then, we're using the ```aws_instance``` resource to create an EC2 instance with the specified ```ami``` (Amazon Machine Image) and ```instance_type```. The ```connection``` block is used to specify the connection details for the EC2 instance, including the type of connection, user, and private key.

Next, we're creating an EBS volume with the ```aws_ebs_volume``` resource and specifying its size and the tags to be applied to it. Finally, we're using the ```aws_volume_attachment``` resource to mount the EBS volume to the EC2 instance.

Regarding security, you can use security groups to control the inbound and outbound network traffic for your EC2 instance. Here's an example of how you can configure a security group that only allows incoming SSH traffic from the outside:

```
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-security-group"
  description = "Allow incoming SSH traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

In this example, the ```aws_security_group``` resource is used to create a security group named ```example-security-group``` with a description of "Allow incoming SSH traffic". The ```ingress``` block is used to specify the incoming traffic that is allowed through the security group, in this case, incoming SSH traffic on port 22 from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).

Once the security group is created, you can associate it with your EC2 instance by adding the following block to your EC2 instance resource definition:

```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ...

  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.example.id}"]
  ...
}
```

This block associates the security group with the EC2 instance by setting the ```vpc_security_group_ids``` attribute to the ID of the security group.
